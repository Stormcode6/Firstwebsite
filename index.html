    <p> The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican or simply Saint Peter's 
        Basilica is a church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican City,
        the papal enclave that is within the city of Rome. It was initially planned
        by Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the aging Old 
        St. Peter's Basilica, which was built in the 4th century by 
        Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Construction of the present 
        basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.
